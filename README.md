# kickstarter-analysis

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose

- To chart varying data sets in order to have a greater understanding of different Kickstarter projects. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- The most successful period of time for Kickstarters to launch was May through June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- The least successful goals reach were $45,000 or more.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Not all necessary data was supplied so I was required to create it from the given data(ie. percentage of Kickstarters successful/fail).

## Results

- The most successful Kickstarters launched in May followed by June as the 2nd most successful and July as 3rd most successful. The LEAST successful campaigns were launched in December.

- Goals Less Than $5000 were the most likely to be reached.

- Some limitations would be how/if the year launched as any relevance to success/failure.

- An interesting data set would be how successful categories/subcategories are compared to each other.
